We were really impressed. <br/><br/>I have the included buffet one morning for breakfast and there were plenty of options including vegan and vegetarian choices. The fresh fruit and barista coffee was nice they made me an almond milk latte especially :) winning... <br/><br/>The hotel was nice to come to - beautiful surroundings and a nice drive to get there.

Teenage children wanted to play 8 ball but the table was jammed in the corner of the golf bar and no one available to move the table. We booked Dinner for my wife's birthday. Two of us had calamari entree. The calamari had been boiled to then grilled. It had the texture of toothpaste. Told waitress but she thanked us for the feedback.
