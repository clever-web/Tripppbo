However, any deviating provisions in the terms of the airline concerned take precedence over its general information provided in this section 3.2.4. Therefore, you should always check what is involved the airline's applicable terms before making your booking. a. Flight times / check-in All specified flight times are local. Arrival the next day is indicated by a "+1" in the timetable. The specified flight times are preliminary and may be changed at short notice after the flight ticket has been issued, for example as a result of restrictions on air traffic control, weather or the airline's functional restrictions. Be sure to yourself check the current times well in advance of departure. Be sure to follow the check-in times specified by the airlines. The airlines have the right to deny you boarding if you are late for check-in. Please note that some airlines encourage their customers to check in via their website and that they can charge a check-in fee for manual check-in the airport. b. Combination of separate single tickets A combination of two separate single tickets instead of a return ticket is clearly marked below the booking procedure. The tickets are processed independently in the event of a canceled flight, change or interruptions in air traffic as a result of, for example, strikes and the airlines' changes in flight times. Each airline applies in these cases their own rules. Airline tickets with different booking numbers are always considered as travel that is independent of each other as above. c. Airline tickets with several routes / order of use Your return ticket or single ticket can consist of several flight routes. According to most airline terms, such flight distances are used in succession. If this does not happen, many airlines will refuse transport subsequent routes (for example, an unused distance on a ticket may invalidate the rest of the ticket). If you have a return ticket and do not use the flight ticket for the departure, your flight ticket may for the return journey is canceled by the airline. d. Pregnancy Some airlines refuse to carry passengers who are pregnant after week 28 at the time of departure or return trip. If you are pregnant, you must check with the airline and your doctor if you can start the journey or not. e. Tickets for children and infants Please contact the airline to obtain the conditions for traveling with a child who does not have a separate one airplane seat. Usually, children over 2 years need a separate seat, while children between 0- and 2-years travel as infants and will not be assigned a separate chair. If the child turns 2 years old before the end of the trip, a child ticket is required booked for the whole trip. Infant tickets cannot be booked before birth, as the correct name and date of birth must match what is stated in the passport. We do not reimburse any costs that arise if the wrong type of ticket is booked. f. Minors without accompanying adult We do not arrange booking of tickets for minors traveling without an accompanying adult. Children under 18 years must be booked and travel in the company of an adult. Some countries and airlines refuse entry for children under 18 years of age if they are not accompanied by a guardian. Please note that some airlines require children under the age of 18 to be able to present their birth certificate when traveling. g. Lost / damaged luggage In our capacity as intermediaries, we take no responsibility for lost or damaged luggage. Any problems with Baggage must be reported immediately to the airline's representative at the airport. h. Transit and overnight stay In general, ground transportation and / or overnight stays during your trip are not included in the flight ticket price. You are personal responsible for checking timetables and prices for ground transport. i. Connection times between flights Standard tickets booked on the Portal have approved connection times. The times required to keep up connecting flights are calculated by the airlines. If you are delayed on a flight distance which leads to a miss connection, the airlines are obliged to help you reach your destination (see section 11.1). When separate single tickets are booked, the airlines have no responsibility for missed connections as a result delay. Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure that the connection time is sufficient based on the airlines and the airports. Any additional costs that arise as a result of missed connections are not reimbursed. j. Double booking A double booking means that two or more bookings with the same passenger’s name have been made with the same airline. If you have double booked, the airline may cancel the trip / trips. This can also occur if the booking has been made at different travel agencies. We are not responsible for airlines' cancellations or for denied refund from the airlines, if they suspect double booking.</p>
