                A combination of two separate single tickets instead of a return ticket is clearly marked below the booking procedure. The tickets are processed independently in the event of a canceled flight, change or interruptions in air traffic as a result of, for example, strikes and the airlines' changes in flight times. Each airline applies in these cases their own rules. Airline tickets with different booking numbers are always considered as travel that is independent of each other as above.

If the child turns 2 years old before the end of the trip, a child ticket is required booked for the whole trip. Infant tickets cannot be booked before birth, as the correct name and date of birth must match what is stated in the passport. We do not reimburse any costs that arise if the wrong type of ticket is booked.

If you purchase our service CANCELLATION GUARANTEE during the booking procedure, you can for any reason contact us after the booking to cancel your booking and instead receive an electronic voucher corresponding to 90% of the price of the flight ticket. The voucher can then be used for a new booking on the Portal. The conditions in this clause 8.4 applies to our service CANCELLATION GUARANTEE but also in the provision of CANCELLATION GUARANTEE we mediate a transport agreement between You and the relevant Service Provider. Since CANCELLATION GUARANTEE is our own service (ie you can not take advantage of CANCELLATION GUARANTEE by contacting The service provider directly) all cancellations for use of the service CANCELLATION GUARANTEE must be made via our customer service (see section 8.4.5). We do not charge any administrative fees in the event of a voluntary cancellation CANCELLATION GUARANTEE or for a new booking with voucher through our Portal.
                8.4.2. The following applies when using the CANCELLATION GUARANTEE service:
                All cancellations must be made in accordance with clause 8.4.5 and be received by us no later than 4 hours before it original flight departure time. The value of the voucher corresponds to 90% of the value of the canceled flight ticket, including taxes and The service provider's fees but excluding the cost of the CANCELLATION GUARANTEE and additional additional services (eg extra luggage, choice of seat, etc.). If the booking has previously been subject to change which has meant an increase in the price of the flight ticket (eg voluntary date change, name change, addition of luggage, etc.) the value of the voucher on the original flight ticket is calculated, without changes. When using CANCELLATION GUARANTEE the value of the voucher can never exceed SEK 25,000 per person or SEK 50,000 per booking regardless of the value of the airline tickets. You always have the right to cancel your flight ticket and receive a voucher for any reason. Cancellation is also possible requested for an individual passenger in the booking, in this case the value of the voucher is calculated in proportion to the number passengers who cancel. Cancellations cannot be made for individual travel distances in a flight ticket. It is not possible to cancel only part of the trip. The voucher can only be used on our Portal according to the instructions that come with your voucher. Vouchers can not combined with other vouchers, cash payments or promotions and can not be used via price comparison sites. You can only use your voucher at one time of booking. Unused voucher amount is then considered forfeited.
                The voucher is valid for 12 months from the time you are notified that the voucher is available for use, which is within 7 days of us confirming your cancellation request. When the validity period expires the voucher loses its value and you can not claim compensation in any other way. A CANCELLATION GUARANTEE voucher can only be used for booking flights on the Portal.
                8.4.3. By using the CANCELLATION GUARANTEE and canceling your booking / a flight ticket, you and your fellow travelers from all rights to the travel documents that We have provided to the Service Provider. By purchase the service CANCELLATION GUARANTEE You accept that We after your notification of cancellation according to the terms automatically acquires all rights to the flight ticket and booking as well as the right to use these rights vis-√†-vis the Service Provider.

                8.4.5. If you want to take advantage of the CANCELLATION GUARANTEE, you must contact our customer service. You can see phone number as well other contact methods on the Portal. Please note that we handle all customer inquiries in turn.
                8.4.6. The cancellation guarantee does not apply if you contact the airline to rebook your flight ticket and request one cancellation case.
